# Speedband

## What is it?
 A python script that logs your average latency, bandwidth speed (both upload and download speeds), and bandwidth usage. It uses the process and system utilities library on Python to get your operating systems information.  

## Features

  - Average latency by pinging https://www.google.com/
  - Average upload and download speed measured in kiloBytes per second
  - Average bandwidth usage since the script has started

More features are being developed, such as using AWS Boto3 SDK for emailing weekly reports of the above information.

## Tech

This app uses Python 3.
